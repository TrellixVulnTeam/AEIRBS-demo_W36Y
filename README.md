### Executive Summary
The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) has protocols that take effect whenever a natural calamity hits the Philippines. One of these protocols is to immediately alert the citizens of impending emergency situations like imminent floods or earthquakes. They make this possible with the use of nation-wide short message services (SMS) to provide immediate and accessible alerts. However, it has experienced delays due to heavy network traffic. Thus, there may be higher casualties even if the protocols are in place.

This study aims to create an emergency alert system that is specifically designed to be installed per building for efficient and effective detection and broadcasting within a smaller and limited group of people. The proposed system, Automatic Emergency Interpreter, Recorder, and Broadcast System (AEIRBS), will be an additional warning system to the existing National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (NDRRMP).
